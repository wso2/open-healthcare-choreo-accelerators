# HL7V2 to FHIR R4 Transformation Accelerator

This accelerator can be used to transform HL7V2 messages to FHIR r4. 

A component in Choreo can be created by pointing the Hl7v2ToFHIRR4 accelerator's [v2-transformation-to-fhir-r4-api-1.0.0](https://github.com/wso2/open-healthcare-choreo-accelerators/tree/v2-transformation-to-fhir-r4-api-1.0.0) branch.
